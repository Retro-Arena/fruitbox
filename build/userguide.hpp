  "Automatically run fruitbox on power up\n" \

  "  sudo ./fruitbox --cfg <your cfg file>\n\n\n" \
  "Automatically mount USB memory stick on power up\n" \
  "------------------------------------------------\n\n" \
  "If your music is stored on a USB memory stick, you can automatically mount the USB memory " \
  "stick at boot time by typing the following commands:\n\n" \
  "  sudo mkdir -p /mnt/usb\n" \
  "  sudo nano /etc/fstab\n\n" \
  "When inside the nano editor, add the following line at the end of the table...\n\n" \
  "/dev/sda1     /mnt/usb       vfat    defaults    0       0\n\n" \
  "Save (Ctrl-O), then Quit nano (Ctrl-X).  Then in your fruitbox configuration file, set the 'MusicPath' parameter to '/mnt/usb/'\n\n\n" \
  "Animated GIF support\n" \
  "--------------------\n\n" \
  "Animated GIF files can be supported by splitting the GIF file into individual files (by using 'ffmpeg -i file.gif file%02d.jpg' for example), " \
  "including them in a [status] section with multiple 'Bitmap' entries, and specifying the animation speed with 'TimerTickPeriod'.  Then " \
  "in your status Contents text file include the text\n'$IF_TIMER_TICK$DRAW_BITMAP'.\n\n\n" \
  "Animated Touchscreen Buttons\n" \
  "----------------------------\n\n" \
  "Configuring buttons for touch input will only cause a button event to be generated if the touch screen is touched " \
  "in the area of the button defined in the skin file [touch areas]; it won't produce any visual effects.  In order to produce an effect of " \
  "the button being pressed visually, you can define a status object which displays an image of the " \
  "depressed button if the button press event has occurred i.e. in the status Contents file you will " \
  "need the text:\n  $IF_BUTTON_LEFT_PRESSED$DRAW_BITMAP$END_IF\n  $IF_NOT_BUTTON_LEFT_PRESSED$UNDRAW_BITMAP$END_IF\n" \
  "for example when pressing ButtonLeft.  If the status object is placed over a image of an unpressed button (i.e. in the background) " \
  "then this will have the desired effect.\n\n\n" \
  "Quick fruitbox style change using USB memory sticks\n" \
  "---------------------------------------------------\n\n" \
  "As a general tip, you can store the configuration file and database file on a USB memory " \
  "stick along with the music, and run fruitbox using the command 'sudo ./fruitbox --cfg /mnt/usb/fruitbox.cfg'.  " \
  "That way, you could have a complete jukebox look and feel with specific music all self-contained on " \
  "the USB stick, so then all you need to do to change jukebox styles and music collections is to swap USB sticks..." \
